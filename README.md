# Portfolio version 2.0

## Languages
```
VueJS, SCSS
```

### Purpose
Version two (2.0) of my portfolio website was to push me out of my comfort zone and start meeting industry standards and requires.  I've pushed myself to start with an easier, but effective front end frame work (VueJS 3). 
At this point, I figured I may as well expand my front end development skills and start using a css preprocessor, SCSS.

Currently, as of this commit, there is no backend development planned for this website as I've shown my backend skills via my [Freelance](https://github.com/debuggingbytes/db_website_v2).

### Development Plans
- State used more frequently for front end, to ensure a better UX
- Responsive design for common breakpoints
- VueX state management
